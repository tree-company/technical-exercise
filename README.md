# Technical exercise

## The situation
You have a data folder containing subfolders. Each subfolder is named after a channel in Slack (a chat program). In each subfolder you will find a collection of JSON files and each JSON file contains an array of JSON objects.
Each JSON object contains anonymised message metadata.

## Your task
Write a computer program that parses all messages in all the channels and exports it to a single CSV file.
Each row in the CSV file must represent one message and each column a metadata attribute.

You get a copy of the expected CSV output file as a reference. You are free to choose any programming or scripting language you like.

You have approximately 1 hour to work on a solution. You are welcome to explain your approach and you can research the documentation of your chosen language.
You are not allowed to look up "how to convert JSON to CSV" online, or use AI-tools and just copy paste some code.
You will have to explain your solution.

## How to start?
Pull in this repository with `git clone git@github.com:tree-company/technical-exercise.git` (If this does not work, you can also download the zip from github)

Good luck!
